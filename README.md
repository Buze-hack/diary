## How It Works

1. Add Entries
   Use the command line or the app interface to add new diary entries with timestamps.

2. View Entries:
   List all previous entries in chronological order.

3. Search:
   Find entries by date or keyword.

4. Edit/Delete:
   Update or remove existing entries as needed.

# Add a new entry

# Search for a keyword
diary search "Markdown"
```
